# Overview

MyDecisive.ai (MDAI) is an open-source self-service control plane for OpenTelemetry that makes it simple to oversee your observability telemetry and control costs efficiently. MDAI provides a self-monitoring container and a pipeline analysis tool for any supported infrastructure. Currently, MDAI is available for AWS.

MDAI is _not_:

- A proprietary observability platform
- A standalone monitoring platform
- A replacement for comprehensive monitoring solutions
- A managed service
 
MDAI is designed to work with OpenTelemetry and vendor platforms to control telemetry flow and reduce the costs associated with unneeded data.
