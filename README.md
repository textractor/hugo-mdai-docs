# MyDecisive Docs on Hugo

The `public`, `resources`, and `static` directories are associated with local publication of the website and should be ignored when using GitPages. `.hugo_build.lock` should also be ignored.

The `archetypes` directory is a sort of template for the front matter of content pages that get created. The `layouts` directory is for HTML templates to control how pages are rendered.

Hugo's union file system means you override themes via a path from the root directory, not by editing theme files. See [this page](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/configuration/sitemanagement/structure/index.html) for a clear explanation and an example.
