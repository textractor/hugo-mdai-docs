# MyDecisive Docs on Hugo

The `public`, `resources`, and `static` directories are associated with local publication of the website and should be ignored when using GitPages. `.hugo_build.lock` should also be ignored.

The `archetypes` directory is a sort of template for the front matter of content pages that get created. The `layouts` directory is for HTML templates to control how pages are rendered.
